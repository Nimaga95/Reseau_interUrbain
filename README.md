# RÃ©seau InterUrbain
## Object

Implementing an interurban transport network using a graph, as well as Dijkstra's algorithm and Kosaraju's algorithm. The program then allows, using a database, to calculate the optimal distance between two cities and the cost of the trip. In short, it's a homemade GPS to master the concepts of algorithms and data structures.

## Utilsation

Just dowload the project and configure your interpreter repertory to the directory of the project. So the project can find the data then execute. This project was build in CLion.
