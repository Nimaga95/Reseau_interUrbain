# RÃ©seau  interUrbain

## Object

Implementing an interurban transport network using a graph, as well as Dijkstra's algorithm and Kosaraju's algorithm. The program then allows, using a database, to calculate the optimal distance between two cities and the cost of the trip. In short, it's a homemade GPS to master the concepts of algorithms and data structures. To be efficient we applied our algorithms to a local compagnie date. 

## Utilsation

Just dowload the project and configure your interpreter repertory to the directory of the project. So the project can find the data then execute. This project was build in CLion.
